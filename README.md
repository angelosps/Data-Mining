## Sentiment Analysis on COVID-19 Vaccines üíâ

In this notebook, we perform sentiment analysis on tweets talking about COVID-19 vaccines. We experiment with several data preprocessing techniques, such as **Bag of Words**, **TF-IDF**, **GloVe** and **Word2Vec**, and plot our results on them. In addition, we classify the tweets into three classes (Neutral, Positive, Negative) using various classifiers such as, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **Random Forests** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**. We provide a detailed comparison for each method we experimented with. We also try to beat the scores of our previous classifiers in the "Beat the Benchmark‚Äù section. Finally, using **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** we categorize our data and generate some topics from it.

## NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction üöï

In this notebook, we analyze data from taxi rides in the greater New York City area. We perform clustering with **K-Means** and regression with **Random Forests Regressor** to predict taxi trip duration. We also create a map of New York City with the pickup and drop-off points of the trips and perform some further data analysis focusing on traffic times.
