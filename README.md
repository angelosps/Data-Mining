## Sentiment Analysis on COVID-19 Vaccines 

In this notebook, we will perform sentiment analysis on tweets talking about COVID-19 vaccines. We will experiment with several data preprocessing techniques, such as **Bag of Words**, **TF-IDF**, **GloVe** and **Word2Vec**, and plot our results on them. In addition, we will classify the tweets into three classes (Neutral, Positive, Negative) using various classifiers such as, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **Random Forests** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**. We provide a detailed comparison for each method we experimented with. We also try to beat the scores of our previous classifiers in the "Beat the Benchmark‚Äù section. Finally, using **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** we categorize our data and generate some topics from it.
